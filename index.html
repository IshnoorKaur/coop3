                For my 4-month co-op, I worked as an OPSSC Co-op Support Officer with the Ministry of Public and
                Business Service Delivery, Infrastructure Technology Services Division. My responsibilities included
                providing front-line IT support to Government of Ontario employees, assisting with hardware, software,
                and mobile device issues, and delivering both remote and in-person technical services. This role allowed
                me to strengthen my technical knowledge, customer service skills, and problem-solving abilities in a
                professional public sector environment.Through these experiences, I deepened my understanding of IT
                systems and strengthened my ability to collaborate effectively with the team. This also gave me valuable
                insights into the
                importance of communication and teamwork in IT support.
